STDP implemented in memristor-spikelearn, using Deephyper for separate and combined algorithm-circuit optimizations.

### How to run the optimization

For algorithm level parameter search (with ideal synapses): [src/stdp_mnist_launcher_local_algorithm.py](src/stdp_mnist_launcher_local_algorithm.py)

For optimization of algorithm-to-circuit mapping marameters (after algorithm level optimization): [src/stdp_mnist_launcher_local_circuit.py](src/stdp_mnist_launcher_local_circuit.py)

For combined algorithm-circuit optimization: [src/stdp_mnist_launcher_local.py](src/stdp_mnist_launcher_local.py)

Before launching, *_PATH variables in the launchers should be changed to appropriate locations to store log, and mnist_path should point to mnist.npz.

### Current status

In pure algorithm-level parameter search, the trials generated by Deephyper never reached **65%** accuracy (Mnist) after 49k test points, while running a standalone instance using "default" parameters can reach **87%**.  
In addition, the results don't seem to improve across several batches of test points. Accuracy is shown as $objective = -log_{10}(1-acc)$ in the [log file](dh_log.csv).
